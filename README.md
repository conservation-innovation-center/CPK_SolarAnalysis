# Chesapeake Bay watershed solar analysis
## Summary
This repository contains Python and R code used to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of solar energy buildout within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Python code was used to process solar array vector data and join geospatial covariate values to polygons. R code was used to fit hierarchical Bayesian models estimating the relationships between geospatial covariates (e.g. land cover, state, distance to transmission lines) and the rate of solar development.
